# re-re-re-react package

A silly name for a package that sets up your Atom editor to be a React powerhouse.

There are also a few planned

# TODO
- [ ] Split up the files
- [ ] Do what is in install.js
- [ ] Let's figure out our directories.
- [ ] Get my custom keymaps to work.
- [ ] Get my custom snippets to work.
- [ ] Get my custom menus to work.
- [ ] Get my custom contextual menus to work.
- [ ] Would I be able to get Nuclide functionality in here?
- [ ] Nuclide's "Working Sets" functionality (https://atom.io/packages/search?q=working+set).
- [ ] Nuclide's debugger support.
- [ ] Make autocomplete + hyperclick work correctly.
- [ ] Figure out how to get a pan on the right working.
	- Put in a debugger & terminal
- [ ] Possibly multi-windows?
- [ ] https://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/
- [ ] Specs?
- [ ] Ignore all core settings.

# Planned Functionality
- [ ] A custom webpack loader to do auto class finding (or something to the effect. Still an idea in my head nothing planned out).
- [ ] Better git support for single files, diff et al.
- [ ] Better autocomplete functionality. Either use Tern or my own custom rolled solution.
- [ ] An NPM helper (run npm scripts from package.json easily)
- [ ] A vagrant helper (If `Vagrantfile` exists then be able to do it's commands).
- [ ] Task Runner.
- [ ] Current file Symbols navigator.
