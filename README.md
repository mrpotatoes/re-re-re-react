# re-re-re-react package

A silly name for a package that sets up your Atom editor to be a React powerhouse.

In order to do this I use the `atom-package-deps` module from npm to download and install many important packages. If found on the system already then no biggie otherwise I'll take up some of your time installing this on first install. I do not uninstall these packages incase you like these.

There are also a few planned features that I would like to implement when I gather the time to do so. They are listed below.

## Warning:
This package kind of takes over your ATOM install so be warned. You may also want to restart your atom to be "safe".
